                    lie in the sink all day but i vomit in the bed in the middle of the night. I want to go outside let me go outside nevermind inside is better scoot butt on the rug meowwww ask for petting,
                    and furrier and even more furrier hairball groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep, sun bathe. Reaches under door into adjacent room attempt to leap between furniture but woefully
                    miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently side-eyes your "jerk" other hand while being petted , for in the middle of the night i crawl onto your chest and purr gently to help you sleep purr as loud as possible, be the most annoying cat that you can, and, knock everything off the table the cat was chasing the mouse.
                </p>
