# PLAYGROUND BLOG 

To start blogging let's first create a blog (and meantime play with some new ideas and technologies).
This is a blog **in progress**. Pushes to master are automatically deployed to Heroku: https://vb-blog.herokuapp.com.

Versions used:

* Ruby version 2.7
* Rails 5.2
* Postgres 12.2

This repository has automatic Actions (I'm soooo proud):
- on push to a PR tests run automatically. Yay!
